Overview
Welcome to the Zangoh AI Agent Supervisor Workstation Challenge! In this challenge, you will build a workstation interface that allows human supervisors to monitor, intervene, and improve AI customer service agents.
Zangoh is developing autonomous AI agents for enterprise customer service. These agents handle routine customer inquiries, but human supervisors need to monitor their performance, step in when necessary, and continuously improve the system. Your task is to build the supervisor workstation that makes this human-in-the-loop workflow possible.
Challenge Duration
You have 3 hours to complete this challenge. Please manage your time accordingly.
Note: You may receive an additional requirement during the challenge. Be prepared to adapt your solution.
Tech Stack
The challenge uses the following technologies:
Backend
Node.js with Express
MongoDB (provided via Docker)
WebSockets for real-time updates
Mock LLM API (for simulating AI responses)
Qdrant Vector Database (for knowledge retrieval)
Frontend
React with hooks
Chakra UI component library
WebSocket client for real-time updates
Recharts for data visualization
Environment Setup
Prerequisites
Docker and Docker Compose
Node.js (v16 or later)
npm or yarn
Git
A modern web browser (Chrome or Firefox recommended)
Setup Steps
Clone the starter repository

 git clone https://github.com/zangoh/supervisor-challenge.git
cd supervisor-challenge


Start the Docker environment

 The challenge environment is containerized to ensure consistency. Start the Docker containers:

 docker-compose up -d
 This will start:


MongoDB database
Qdrant vector database
Backend API server
Frontend development server
Mock LLM API
Conversation simulator
Verify services are running

 Check that all services are up and running:

 docker ps
 You should see containers for backend, frontend, mongodb, qdrant, and simulator.


Access the application


Frontend: http://localhost:3000
Backend API: http://localhost:8080
API Documentation: http://localhost:8080/api-docs
Initialize test data (if needed)

 The environment comes pre-loaded with test data, but if you need to reset it:

 docker-compose exec backend npm run seed

UI Design Reference
All UI designs are provided in Figma and as static images in the mockups folder. Your implementation should follow these designs.
Figma Link: [FIGMA_LINK_HERE]
The designs include:
Dashboard/Overview Screen: Showing key metrics and conversation lists
Conversation Detail/Intervention Screen: For monitoring and intervening in conversations
Agent Configuration Screen: For adjusting AI agent parameters and capabilities
Focus on implementing the functionality according to these designs. Pixel-perfect reproduction is not required, but your implementation should closely match the overall layout and user experience.
Available APIs
The backend provides the following API endpoints:
Conversations
GET /api/conversations: Get all conversations with filtering
GET /api/conversations/:id: Get a specific conversation
POST /api/conversations/:id/messages: Add a message to a conversation
PATCH /api/conversations/:id/status: Update conversation status
POST /api/conversations/:id/tags: Add tags to a conversation
Agents
GET /api/agents: Get all agents
GET /api/agents/:id: Get a specific agent
PATCH /api/agents/:id/config: Update agent configuration
GET /api/agents/:id/metrics: Get agent performance metrics
Intervention
POST /api/intervene: Intervene in a conversation
POST /api/intervene/release: End intervention and return to agent
Knowledge Base
GET /api/knowledge-base: Get all knowledge bases
LLM Mock API
POST /api/llm/generate: Generate LLM response
POST /api/llm/sentiment: Analyze text sentiment
WebSocket API
The WebSocket server provides real-time updates for:
New conversations
Message updates
Metrics changes
Agent status changes
Refer to the API documentation at http://localhost:8080/api-docs for detailed information.
Testing Your Implementation
A testing script is provided to help you validate your implementation. Run it with:
cd testing
npm install
node test-runner.js

This will check the core functionality of your implementation and provide feedback on what's working and what needs attention.
Implementation Requirements
Your implementation should include:
1. Agent Monitoring Dashboard
Real-time view of active customer conversations with AI agents
Key metrics display (resolution rate, average response time, customer satisfaction)
Alert system for potentially problematic conversations
Filtering options (by agent, status, alert level)
2. Intervention Interface
Ability to view full conversation history for any active session
"Take over" functionality to assume control from the AI agent
Agent performance feedback mechanism
Option to return control to the AI with notes/guidance
3. Agent Configuration
Adjust AI parameters (temperature, max tokens, etc.)
Enable/disable specific capabilities or knowledge domains
Configure automatic escalation thresholds
Save and load configuration presets
Tips for Success
Start with core functionality: Implement the basic features first before adding polish
Use the provided components: The starter code includes basic components you can build upon
Test incrementally: Use the testing script to validate your progress
Manage your time: Allocate time for each major feature, leaving time for integration and testing
Read the API docs: Understand the available endpoints before implementation
Study the designs: Familiarize yourself with all screens before starting to understand the complete system
Submission
When you're done, submit your solution as follows:
Ensure all code is committed:

 git add .
git commit -m "Final submission"


Create a zip file of your solution:

 # From the project root
zip -r submission.zip . -x "node_modules/*" "*/node_modules/*" ".git/*"


Upload your submission to the platform or provide a GitHub repository link as instructed


Include in your submission:


Complete source code
Setup instructions if you've modified the environment
Brief description of your implementation, challenges faced, and solutions
Any notes for the evaluator
Evaluation Criteria
Your solution will be evaluated based on:
Functionality (40%): Does it fulfill all the requirements?
Code Quality (25%): Is the code well-structured, maintainable, and efficient?
